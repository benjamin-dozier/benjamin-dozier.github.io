<h3> About Me </h3> 

<ul>
  I've recently completed my PhD in mathematics at Stanford University.
<br />
  From July-December 2018, I will be postdoctoral fellow at the Fields Institute in Toronto for the thematic program on Teichmuller theory.

  <br />
  In January 2019, I will start a postdoc as a Simons Instructor at Stony Brook University.  

  <br />
    My research is in Teichmuller dynamics, and I have been advised by Maryam Mirzakhani and Alex Wright.  
</ul>

<p><ul><font size=+0><b>Abstract:</b>
Fix a translation surface X, and consider the measures on X coming from averaging the uniform measures on all the saddle connections of length at most R.  Then as R goes to infinity, the weak limit of these measures exists and is equal to the Lebesgue measure on X.  We also  show that any weak limit of a subsequence of the counting measures on S^1 given by the angles of all saddle connections of length at most R_n, as R_n goes to infinity, is in the Lebesgue measure class.  The proof of the first result uses the second result, together with the result of Kerckhoff-Masur-Smillie that the directional flow on a surface is uniquely ergodic in almost every direction.

<p><ul><font size=+0><b>Abstract:</b>
We show that for any weakly convergent sequence of ergodic SL2(R)-invariant probability measures on a stratum of unit-area translation surfaces, the corresponding Siegel-Veech constants converge to the Siegel-Veech constant of the limit measure. Together with a measure equidistribution result due to Eskin-Mirzakhani-Mohammadi, this yields the (previously conjectured) convergence of sequences of Siegel-Veech constants associated to Teichmuller curves in genus two. 
The proof uses a recurrence result closely related to techniques developed by Eskin-Masur. We also use this recurrence result to get an asymptotic quadratic upper bound, with a uniform constant depending only on the stratum, for the number of saddle connections of length at most R on a unit-area translation surface.
