Title: <I> The torus trick
  </I>
</DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
We give the shortest proof of the existence and uniqueness of smooth structures in dimension 2, using handle smoothening and Kirby's torus trick. If time permits, we'll comment on what the same techniques can achieve in dimension 3 and dimension at least 5.

Title: <I> SU(2) Character Variety </I>
</DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Description: In this talk (possibly series of talks), I'll be discussing the mapping class group action on the character varieties. I'll start by introducing the basics, including the definition of character varieties and the MCG actions. The goal is to prove Goldman's theorem that the action is ergodic on the SU(2)-character variety

Title: <I> Thurston's Minimal Stretch Maps </I>
</DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Description: Given two hyperbolic surfaces of the same topological type, what can we say about the smallest Lipschitz constant of a Lipschitz homeomorphism between the two surfaces?  Thurston developed a theory to address this question: he proves that the above quantity is equal to the supremum of ratios of lengths of closed geodesics in the two surfaces.  Among the most efficient Lipschitz maps are the minimal stretch maps, which have a rather concrete description in terms of geodesic laminations on the surface.  I'll describe the main results of this theory.  Although this parallels the theory of the Teichmuller metric, I won't assume you know about that, so the talk should be relatively self-contained, and will include lots of pictures!

</DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Description: Sander is going to talk about Hatcher's proofs that the full arc complex of a surface and the full sphere complex of a three-manifold diffeomorphic to a connected sum of S^1 \times S^2's are both contractible.  Sander promises that it's really pretty.

Title: <I>  Zeeman's Conjecture</I>
</DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Description: Zeeman's conjecture says that for every contractible 2-dimensional polyhedron K the product K x I is collapsible. We give several examples and partial results, and explain how to see that Zeeman's conjecture for restricted classes of K is equivalent to the Poincare and Andrew-Curtis conjectures.

Title: <I>  Skein Algebras and the Decorated Teichmuller Space </I>
</DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Abstract: The Kauffman bracket skein module K(M) of a 3-manifold M is defined by Przytycki and Turaev as an invariant for framed links in M satisfying the Kauffman skein relation. For a compact oriented surface S, it is shown by Bullock-Frohman-Kania-Bartoszynska and Przytycki-Sikora that K(S x [0, 1]) is a quantization of the SL_2(C)-characters of the fundamental group of S with respect to the Goldman-Weil-Petersson Poisson bracket.

In the joint work with Julien Roger that I will be talking about, we define a skein algebra of a punctured surface as an invariant for not only framed links but also framed arcs in S x [0, 1] satisfying the skein relations of crossings both in the surface and at punctures. This algebra quantizes a Poisson algebra of loops and arcs on S in the sense of deformation of Poisson structures. This construction provides a tool to quantize the decorated Teichmuller space; and the key ingredient in this construction is a collection of geodesic lengths identities in hyperbolic geometry which generalizes/is inspired by Penner's Ptolemy relation, the trace identity and Wolpert's cosine formula.

Title: <I> Geodesic intersection number and the Goldman bracket </I>
</DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Abstract: The Goldman Bracket is a Lie bracket that turns the set of free homotopy classes of curves on a surface S into a Lie algebra. I will show how this algebraic invariant can be used to compute the geometric intersection number between two curves. There will be lots of pictures!

Title: <I> Incompressible surfaces, Haken manifolds, and hierarchies </I>
</DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Abstract: The study of embedded incompressible surfaces has proved central to our understanding of 3-dimensional manifolds. If an irreducible 3-manifold has a properly embedded two-sided incompressible surface, we call it Haken. Cutting open a Haken manifold by such a surface often simplifies the topology. If a finite number of such decompositions results in a disjoint union of 3-balls, we call the sequence of decompositions a hierarchy. Haken hierarchies have been used to solve the recognition problem and to prove topological rigidity (both for Haken manifolds), as well as to construct hyperbolic structures (Thurston's hyperbolization for Haken manifolds). Furthermore, Ian Agol recently proved the Haken conjecture, namely that every compact, orientable, irreducible 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group is virtually Haken (it has a finite cover that is Haken). In this talk we will prove that every Haken manifold admits a hierarchy.

Title: <I> Earthquakes, Part I</I>
</DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Description: Let S be a closed surface of genus g, and consider its mapping class group, i.e. the group of diffeomorphisms modulo isotopy.  Nielsen posed the following question: can every finite subgroup of the mapping class group be lifted to a subgroup of the group of diffeomorphisms?  This was resolved in the affirmative by Kerckhoff, who proved the stronger statement that every finite subgroup of the mapping class group is realizable as a subgroup of isometries for a hyperbolic structure on the surface.  Thus geometry enters the game.  A key tool that pops up in the proof is the Earthquake Flow on the space of hyperbolic structures, which really does look like an earthquake deforming a hyperbolic surface.  I'll introduce the relevant background material and give a sketch of Kerckhoff's proof.
